						<h2>Assighment 0:</h2>
						<i>09/21/16</i>
					</header>
					<p>I had trouble not using css.  I'm so used to just adding a style element (if the page is small) and restyling the page.
					It made me think outside of the box.  For example, I remembered the font and center tags back from when I learned HTML 4.</p>
					<p>I had to look up the font tag but my IDE recommeded the center tag.</p>
					<p>Speaking of old tags, I'm going to get to use what used to be my favorite tag: the horizontal rule.</p>

						<h2>Assignment 1:</h2>
						<i>10/10/16</i>
					</header>
					<p>This assignment was pretty easy, I enjoyed trying to recreate from a mock.
						I feel like working from a mock is more like what I would do in a job.
						It was also interesting to create something that someone else designed.
					</p>
					<p>
						I didn't need to look up anything for this assignment, but while working on
						it, I remembered the new CSS grid layout spec.  I've been reading up
						on CSS grid because of this assignment although I didn't end up using it.

						I decided to use web components for this assignment.  I've been trying to learn web components for a while now but my head keeps exploading.  The first time my head exploaded was when I learned that I could make my own elements.  The second time was when I learned that I could hide various containers that I was using for styling behind the Shadow DOM.  Just a few days ago, my brain exploaded when I found out that customElements have lifecycle callbacks.  I thought this was great until Rob Hess mentioned Delegated event handlers and, once again, my brain exploaded.
					</p>
					<p>
						I still can't wrap my head around trying to optimize event delegation with web components, but I want to think about it more.  And maybe come up with a codepen or something.
					</p>
					<p>
						Overall though, I think that this assignment was a good one for practicing web components.  Some of the decisions I made don't make very much sense (like hiding the entire new todo dialog in the shadow dom) but at least I practiced almost all of the different web component parts at least once.
					</p>
					<p>
						Throughout, I've been using a lot of the Mozilla Developer Network.  Occasionally, I'll look up an article on html5rocks, davidwalsh and sitepoint.  I had to read some articles on styling the Shadow DOM and I still could have done it better.
					</p>
					<p>
						I read about how to register new elements.  I learned by debugging that you can't add attributes while in the element's constructor.  And lastly, I learned that I want to keep playing with web components.

						<h2>Assignment 3:</h2>
						<i>10/30/16</i>
					</header>
					<p>
						This was a pretty fun assignment.  I've never used Node's streams before so I thought that they would be a good way of implementing this server.  I think that was a good choice because my server could serve multiple files at one time and the client starts getting the file as I'm reading it, rather than after it is all done.
					</p>
					<p>
						I also noticed that the caching really made a speed boost.  This could be in part that I was installing something and the installer was hoging my disk because normally my servers, even appache, don't take seconds to load.
					</p>
					<p>
						I enjoyed learning about the Node standard library.  It seems very small in comparison to the c++ standard library, but it is well suited for web development.  It covers the basics that you encounter while doing web development, and then the NPM has everything else you might need.
					</p>
					<p>
						The only resource that I needed was the Node documentation.  It has all of the standard library in it.
					</p>
					<p>
						I'm looking forward to working on the Final Project and learning more about databases and server side Node.
