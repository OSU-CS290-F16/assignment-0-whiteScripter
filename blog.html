					<p>I had trouble not using css.  I'm so used to just adding a style element (if the page is small) and restyling the page.  
					It made me think outside of the box.  For example, I remembered the font and center tags back from when I learned HTML 4.</p>
					<p>I had to look up the font tag but my IDE recommeded the center tag.</p>
					<p>Speaking of old tags, I'm going to get to use what used to be my favorite tag: the horizontal rule.</p>

						<h2>Assignment 1:</h2>
						<i>10/10/16</i>
					</header>
					<p>This assignment was pretty easy, I enjoyed trying to recreate from a mock.
						I feel like working from a mock is more like what I would do in a job.
						It was also interesting to create something that someone else designed.
					</p>
					<p>
						I didn't need to look up anything for this assignment, but while working on 
						it, I remembered the new CSS grid layout spec.  I've been reading up
						on CSS grid because of this assignment although I didn't end up using it.
