					<p>I had trouble not using css.  I'm so used to just adding a style element (if the page is small) and restyling the page.  
					It made me think outside of the box.  For example, I remembered the font and center tags back from when I learned HTML 4.</p>
					<p>I had to look up the font tag but my IDE recommeded the center tag.</p>
					<p>Speaking of old tags, I'm going to get to use what used to be my favorite tag: the horizontal rule.</p>
