					<p>I had trouble not using css.  I'm so used to just adding a style element (if the page is small) and restyling the page.
					It made me think outside of the box.  For example, I remembered the font and center tags back from when I learned HTML 4.</p>
					<p>I had to look up the font tag but my IDE recommeded the center tag.</p>
					<p>Speaking of old tags, I'm going to get to use what used to be my favorite tag: the horizontal rule.</p>

						<h2>Assignment 1:</h2>
						<i>10/10/16</i>
					</header>
					<p>This assignment was pretty easy, I enjoyed trying to recreate from a mock.
						I feel like working from a mock is more like what I would do in a job.
						It was also interesting to create something that someone else designed.
					</p>
					<p>
						I didn't need to look up anything for this assignment, but while working on
						it, I remembered the new CSS grid layout spec.  I've been reading up
						on CSS grid because of this assignment although I didn't end up using it.

						<h2>Assignment 2:</h2>
						<i>10/18/16</i><br />
						<a href="https://github.com/OSU-CS290-F16/assignment-2-whiteScripter">Github assignment</a><br />
						<a href="assign-2">Link to the todo app assignment</a> (It only works in Chrome because I'm playing with html imports.)

					<p>
						I decided to use web components for this assignment.  I've been trying to learn web components for a while now but my head keeps exploading.  The first time my head exploaded was when I learned that I could make my own elements.  The second time was when I learned that I could hide various containers that I was using for styling behind the Shadow DOM.  Just a few days ago, my brain exploaded when I found out that customElements have lifecycle callbacks.  I thought this was great until Rob Hess mentioned Delegated event handlers and, once again, my brain exploaded.
					</p>
					<p>
						I still can't wrap my head around trying to optimize event delegation with web components, but I want to think about it more.  And maybe come up with a codepen or something.
					</p>
					<p>
						Overall though, I think that this assignment was a good one for practicing web components.  Some of the decisions I made don't make very much sense (like hiding the entire new todo dialog in the shadow dom) but at least I practiced almost all of the different web component parts at least once.
					</p>
					<p>
						Throughout, I've been using a lot of the Mozilla Developer Network.  Occasionally, I'll look up an article on html5rocks, davidwalsh and sitepoint.  I had to read some articles on styling the Shadow DOM and I still could have done it better.
					</p>
					<p>
						I read about how to register new elements.  I learned by debugging that you can't add attributes while in the element's constructor.  And lastly, I learned that I want to keep playing with web components.
